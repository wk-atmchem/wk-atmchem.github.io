# How much does the biogenic volatile organic compounds emitted from terrestrial system account for summertime ozone pollution in China?

# Introduction
Biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions from terrestrial ecosystems (especially broadleaf evergreen trees) are recognized to play an essential role in global carbon cycle and climate change. Globally, the BVOC emissions are about 10 larger than the anthropogenic VOC (AVOC) emissions, which means that planting trees without type selection will lead severe air pollution in urban areas (Figure 1). And BVOC emissions have significant impacts on the oxidation capacity in the atmosphere due to its large quantity and high reactivity. BVOC such as isoprene and monoterpene undergo rapid oxidation in the atmosphere then forms the air pollutants tropospheric ozone and biogenic secondary organic aerosol (BSOA) and could therefore cause damage to human health and vegetation growth.

# Who should pay attention to BVOC?
It is critical for farmers, environmental policymakers in environmental protection agency (EPA) and NGOs to further understand the biogenic VOC emissions and its impacts on ozone formation in order to mitigate the effects of ozone pollution by effective emission control strategies.

# The BVOC emission in China
In the present work by Wu et al.(2020), biogenic VOC emissions from China in 2017 were estimated based on the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN). The distribution pattern of BVOC in spring and autumn is quite consistent and mainly concentrated in southern China due to the relatively dense vegetation cover in southern China. Additionally, decreasing temperature and solar radiation from south to north contribute to the distribution of isoprene emissions in southern China. In summer, eastern China has high temperatures, intense radiation and vigorous forest growth, subsequently resulting in obviously higher BVOC emissions (Figure 2 & 3).

# The impact of BVOC emission on ozone
The effects of BVOC emissions on ozone was investigated using the WRF-CMAQ modeling system. Three parallel scenarios were developed to assess the impact of BVOC emissions on China's ozone formation in July 2017. Biogenic emissions were estimated at 23.54 Tg/yr, with a peak in the summer and decreasing from southern to northern China. The high BVOC emissions across eastern and southwestern China increased the surface ozone levels, particularly in the BTH (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei), SCB (Sichuan Basin), YRD (Yangtze River Delta) and central PRD (Pearl River Delta) regions, with increases of up to 47 µg/m3 due to the sensitivity of VOC-limited urban areas.

# Highlights
This work updates the BVOC emissions inventory through high resolution satellite data and numerical models, which promote our understanding of biogenic emission’s role in air pollution. Additionally, it also points out that the control of biogenic VOC emission can’t be neglected by the policymakers when determining the air quality improvements in China.
