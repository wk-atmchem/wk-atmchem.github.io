# About model simulation
## data assimilation and nudging applied
Was data assimilation or nudging of large scale meteorological field (NCEP final analysis data) applied? 72 hour is long for plume simulations without any of these adjustments of large-scale forcing.


# About further discussion
## limitation of case study
Some additional discussion is needed at the end of the paper to stress that the authors have examined one case and put this study into the proper context. They do mention that this case is for fair weather conditions when one might expect a larger impact of the UHI on the local meteorology. However, it would also be interesting to know how strong synoptic forcing needs to be that would overwhelm the UHI and the effects on air quality presented in this study.
