# About model simulation
## data assimilation and nudging applied
Comment:Was data assimilation or nudging of large scale meteorological field (NCEP final analysis data) applied? 72 hour is long for plume simulations without any of these adjustments of large-scale forcing.

## model results validation
Comment:It is not known how well the model represents key factors, such as the magnitude of the UHI, differences in boundary layer height between the city and outside of the city, and winds in the city core that will affect the conclusions drawn in this study. The authors need to include key results from that study that demonstrate the model performs reasonably well in representing observed temperature and winds in the urban area. Readers need to know if there are sufficient observations to verify the meteorological model predictions, otherwise, the present study is simply more of a modeling exercise that may or may not represent the true impact of the UHI on air quality predictions.

# About further discussion
## limitation of case study
Comment:Some additional discussion is needed at the end of the paper to stress that the authors have examined one case and put this study into the proper context. They do mention that this case is for fair weather conditions when one might expect a larger impact of the UHI on the local meteorology. However, it would also be interesting to know how strong synoptic forcing needs to be that would overwhelm the UHI and the effects on air quality presented in this study.

Response: Following your comment, we included the point you mentioned and stressed the necessity of
further studies at the end of the paper. 

# About grammer erros
Comment:While the paper is well organized, there are numerous grammatical errors, some of which are pointed out in the specific comments. I likely did not catch all of them and suggest that the authors find an editor to help them with the final manuscript.

# About references
Comment:References: I noticed at least one reference cited in the text that was not included in the reference list. The authors should check all references to make sure they are properly cited.
