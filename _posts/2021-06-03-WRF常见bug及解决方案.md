# Summary of WRF bugs and solutions 
* [WRF Errors: WARNING: Field XXX has missing values]
When running metgrid.exe, I encountered the following error:

      'WARNING: Field PRES has missing values at level 200100 at (i,j)=(1,1)'
      'WARNING: Field PRES has missing values at level 200100 at (i,j)=(1,1)'
      'WARNING: Field PRESSURE has missing values at level 200100 at (i,j)=(1,1)'
      'WARNING: Field PMSL has missing values at level 200100 at (i,j)=(1,1)'
      'WARNING: Field PSFC has missing values at level 200100 at (i,j)=(1,1)'
      'WARNING: Field SOILHGT has missing values at level 200100 at (i,j)=(1,1)'
      'ERROR: Missing values encountered in interpolated fields. Stopping.'

The solution was so easy. In short, please check that your ungribbed data domain includes the domain which you are trying to extract with metgrid.
解决方案：下载的再分析资料小于模型模拟设置的domain，下载更大范围的再分析资料即可
The error occurs when the intermediate files prepared by ungrib.exe (and, potentially, calc_ecmwf_p.exe) do not cover the full domain as defined in namelist.wps. This can happen, e.g., if the meteorological fields are not global. In my case, I had downloaded ECMWF data for central Europe only, and then later extended the model domain a bit. Once I re-downloaded the meteorological data, everything went smoothly.
