## 1.**加州政府法规 **

**Assembly Bill No. 1496, Chapter 604, Section 39731 (Thurmond, 2015)**
Link:https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160AB1496
Assembly Bill No. 1496
**SECTION 1. The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:**
**(a)** Methane is a gas that is emitted from both natural and human sources. Its concentration in the global atmosphere has more than doubled since the beginning of the industrial revolution. Methane is a short-lived climate pollutant with a lifetime of only about 12 years when released into the atmosphere. It is an extremely potent greenhouse gas, with 20 to 30 times the warming power of carbon dioxide over a 100-year period and more than 80 times over a 20-year period.
**(b)** The life-cycle greenhouse gas emission from the drilling, production, and transportation of natural gas can result in methane leaks, and there is a need for much better information on the life-cycle methane emissions resulting from California’s imports of natural gas.
**(c)** Recent satellite studies have shown methane hot spots in the San Joaquin Valley and higher levels of emissions than were previously estimated from the principal sources of methane in California. There is an urgent need to improve the monitoring and measurement of methane emissions from the major sources in California.
SEC. 2. Section 39731 is added to the Health and Safety Code, to read:

**(1)The state board shall do all of the following:**
(a) Undertake, in consultation with districts that monitor methane, monitoring and measurements of high-emission methane hot spots in the state using the best available and cost-effective scientific and technical methods.
(b) Consult with federal and state agencies, independent scientific experts, and any other appropriate entities to gather or acquire the necessary information for the purpose of carrying out a life-cycle greenhouse gas emission analysis of natural gas produced and imported into the state using the best available and cost-effective scientific and technical methods.
(c) Update relevant policies and programs to incorporate the information gathered and acquired pursuant to subdivisions (a) and (b).
(d) Review, in consultation with independent scientific experts, the most recent available scientific data and reports on the atmospheric reactivity of methane as a precursor to the formation of photochemical oxidants.

### SECTION 1.

 (a) The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:

(1) Short-lived climate pollutants, such as black carbon, fluorinated gases, and methane, are powerful climate forcers that have a dramatic and detrimental effect on air quality, public health, and climate change.

(1) 短寿命气候污染物，如黑碳、氟化气体和甲烷，是强大的气候驱动因素，对空气质量、公共卫生和气候变化产生巨大的不利影响。

(2) These pollutants create a warming influence on the climate that is many times more potent than that of carbon dioxide.

(2) 这些污染物对气候的变暖影响比二氧化碳强很多倍。

(3) Short-lived climate pollutants that are toxic air contaminants also are a significant environmental risk factor for premature death.

(3) 作为有毒空气污染物的短寿命气候污染物也是导致过早死亡的重要环境风险因素。

(4) Reducing emissions of these pollutants can have an immediate beneficial impact on climate change and on public health.

(4) 减少这些污染物的排放可以对气候变化和公众健康产生直接的有益影响。

(5) To the extent possible, efforts to reduce emissions of short-lived climate pollutants should focus on areas of the state that are disproportionately affected by poor air quality.

(5) 在可能的情况下，减少短期气候污染物排放的努力应集中在受不良空气质量影响较大的地区。

(b) It is the intent of the Legislature to support the adoption of policies that improve organics recycling and innovative, cost effective, and environmentally beneficial uses of biomethane derived from solid waste facilities.

(b) 立法机关的意图是支持通过改进有机物回收和创新、具有成本效益且对环境有益地使用源自固体废物设施的生物甲烷的政策。

(c) It is intent of the Legislature that the disposal reduction targets established pursuant to Section 39730.6 of the Health and Safety Code shall serve as a statewide average target and not as a minimum requirement for each jurisdiction.

(c) 立法机关的意图是，根据《健康与安全法》第 39730.6 节制定的减少处置目标应作为全州平均目标，而不是作为每个司法管辖区的最低要求。

Assembly Bill No. 1496, Chapter 604, Section 39731 (Thurmond, 2015)
In 2015, the Governor approved Assembly Bill 1496 (AB 1496) which requires CARB to do the following:
**(I)** Undertake monitoring and measurements of high emission methane "hot spots"
**(II)** Life‑cycle greenhouse gas emissions analysis of natural gas produced and imported into California
**(III)** Review and assess the atmospheric reactivity of methane as a precursor to the formation of photochemical oxidant
**(IV)** Update relevant policies and programs to incorporate new information

**Background**
A recent analysis of satellite data conducted by scientists from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the University of Michigan found a large methane “hot spot” over the Central Valley in California, and this was likely the second largest “hot spot” over the entire United States. Other areas of the State also have enhanced methane concentrations. These atmospheric methane enhancements were persistent over the 2003-2009 period and emphasize the need to identify the many contributing sources throughout the State for an effective emission mitigation program.

#### Overview of California's Efforts to Understand and Reduce Methane Sources

Methane is an important short-lived climate pollutant (SLCP) and also has significant health implications as a tropospheric ozone precursor. As part of a comprehensive effort to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions overall by 40% from 1990 levels by 2030, California has proposed an SLCP Strategy that includes a 40% reduction of methane emissions from 2013 levels by 2030, with goals to reduce oil and gas related emissions and capture methane emissions from dairy operations and organic waste. A recent analysis of satellite data found a large methane "hot spot" over the Central Valley in California, likely the second largest over the entire U.S. In light of this finding, the California legislature passed Assembly Bill 1496 in 2015, which requires the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to undertake measurements to understand the sources of methane hot spots, evaluate life-cycle emissions from natural gas imported into California, and update relevant policies and programs. There is growing evidence in the recent scientific literature suggesting that a small fraction of methane sources within a category emit disproportionately higher emissions than their counterparts, usually referred to as "super emitters". As such, controlling these sources may provide a lower cost opportunity for methane reductions needed to meet near- and long-term climate goals. In order to achieve a comprehensive understanding of sources contributing to "hot spots", CARB, the California Energy Commission, and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory are implementing a large-scale statewide methane survey using a tiered monitoring and measurement program, which will include airborne and ground-level measurements of the various regions and source sectors in the State. This presentation will discuss research and program implementation efforts to evaluate and mitigate methane super emitters and hot spots. These efforts are expected to improve our understanding of methane emission source distributions, improve the estimate of the overall magnitude of anthropogenic methane emissions in California, and inform and improve the effectiveness of methane reduction policies and programs.
