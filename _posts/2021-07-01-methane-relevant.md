Assembly Bill No. 1496, Chapter 604, Section 39731 (Thurmond, 2015)

Assembly Bill No. 1496
**SECTION 1. The Legislature finds and declares all of the following:**
**(a)** Methane is a gas that is emitted from both natural and human sources. Its concentration in the global atmosphere has more than doubled since the beginning of the industrial revolution. Methane is a short-lived climate pollutant with a lifetime of only about 12 years when released into the atmosphere. It is an extremely potent greenhouse gas, with 20 to 30 times the warming power of carbon dioxide over a 100-year period and more than 80 times over a 20-year period.
**(b)** The life-cycle greenhouse gas emission from the drilling, production, and transportation of natural gas can result in methane leaks, and there is a need for much better information on the life-cycle methane emissions resulting from California’s imports of natural gas.
**(c)** Recent satellite studies have shown methane hot spots in the San Joaquin Valley and higher levels of emissions than were previously estimated from the principal sources of methane in California. There is an urgent need to improve the monitoring and measurement of methane emissions from the major sources in California.
SEC. 2. Section 39731 is added to the Health and Safety Code, to read:

**(1)The state board shall do all of the following:**
(a) Undertake, in consultation with districts that monitor methane, monitoring and measurements of high-emission methane hot spots in the state using the best available and cost-effective scientific and technical methods.
(b) Consult with federal and state agencies, independent scientific experts, and any other appropriate entities to gather or acquire the necessary information for the purpose of carrying out a life-cycle greenhouse gas emission analysis of natural gas produced and imported into the state using the best available and cost-effective scientific and technical methods.
(c) Update relevant policies and programs to incorporate the information gathered and acquired pursuant to subdivisions (a) and (b).
(d) Review, in consultation with independent scientific experts, the most recent available scientific data and reports on the atmospheric reactivity of methane as a precursor to the formation of photochemical oxidants.

**(2)CARB: Methane Hotspots Research (AB 1496)**

Assembly Bill No. 1496, Chapter 604, Section 39731 (Thurmond, 2015)
In 2015, the Governor approved Assembly Bill 1496 (AB 1496) which requires CARB to do the following:
**(I)** Undertake monitoring and measurements of high emission methane "hot spots"
**(II)** Life‑cycle greenhouse gas emissions analysis of natural gas produced and imported into California
**(III)** Review and assess the atmospheric reactivity of methane as a precursor to the formation of photochemical oxidant
**(IV)** Update relevant policies and programs to incorporate new information

**Background**
A recent analysis of satellite data conducted by scientists from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the University of Michigan found a large methane “hot spot” over the Central Valley in California, and this was likely the second largest “hot spot” over the entire United States. Other areas of the State also have enhanced methane concentrations. These atmospheric methane enhancements were persistent over the 2003-2009 period and emphasize the need to identify the many contributing sources throughout the State for an effective emission mitigation program.
